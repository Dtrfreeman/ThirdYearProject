 * solveFirstThreeDHJoints Solve for the first three joint angles of a DH-parameterized robot
 *    This function computes the first three joint angles of a robot
 *    parameterized using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. The function accepts
 *    a matrix of the fixed DH parameters, as well as the position of the
 *    fifth joint. The matrix of DH parameters is of size 6x4 for the 6
 *    non-fixed joints, where each row has the order [a alpha d 0], where a
 *    is a translation along x, alpha is a rotation about x, and d is a
 *    translation along z. The last value, which typically refers to theta
 *    (the rotation about z) for that joint, is not yet known; this function
 *    will solve for theta for the first three joints. When a robot has the
 *    last three axes intersecting, the position and orientation of the end
 *    effector can be split up: the position is entirely determined by the
 *    first three joints, while the orientation is governed by the last three
 *    joints (provided the first three are known). Furthermore, the position
 *    of any end effector can be related to the position of the fifth joint
 *    frame, which corresponds to the joint frame at the midpoint of the
 *    three intersecting joints. This frame will have the same position in
 *    any valid solution to the particular IK problem (though its orientation
 *    may differ), and its translation relative to the base frame is entirely
 *    defined by the first three joints. This function solves for those first
 *    three joints given the position of the joint 5 frame relative to the
 *    base. This solution method and notation follows Chp.3 of Pieper's 1968
 *    thesis, but adds two corrections, as well as minor notation changes and
 *    the addition of constraints to ensure only feasible solutions are
 *    output:
